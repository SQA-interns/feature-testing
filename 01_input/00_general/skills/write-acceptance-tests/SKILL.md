description: Write and freeze the black-box acceptance tests from the given acceptance criteria and end-to-end scenarios and the contracts, before any production code exists (phase 3).

- Reads: `project/01_requirements/acceptance-criteria.md`, `project/01_requirements/e2e-scenarios.md`, `docs/02_contracts/`, `general/quality/test-strategy.md`, `general/phases.md`
- Writes: acceptance and end-to-end tests, `docs/03_acceptance-manifest.sha256`, `docs/03_test-strategy.md`
- Does not read: production source code

## Procedure

1. For every AC, write at least one test through the component's public interface that checks the observable outcome the AC states. For a rejection AC, also check that nothing changed. For every scenario in `e2e-scenarios.md`, write exactly one end-to-end test; write no other end-to-end test, and do not split or merge scenarios.
2. Put the AC id in each test name.
3. Run the suite. Every test must fail because the behaviour is missing, not because of a build, configuration or harness error; a test that passes only on bootstrap code is listed in step 4. Fix the harness until that holds.
4. Record the run (pass/fail counts and a one-line reason per group of failures) in `docs/03_test-strategy.md`.
5. Self-check every assertion and helper before the freeze, because a defective frozen test costs a blocking decision: confirm that a correct implementation can make it pass, and that it cannot pass or fail for the wrong reason. Check what each helper returns and what each matcher compares (known cases: the PostgreSQL JDBC driver returns java.sql.Timestamp, not OffsetDateTime, for 	imestamptz unless the type is requested; AssertJ doesNotContain on a yte[] tests single bytes, not a byte sequence, so compare the first bytes with Arrays.copyOf instead). A test must not contradict another assertion in the same test.
6. Format and lint the tests now; after freezing they cannot change.
7. Commit the tests story by story as you finish them. Then write the manifest (normalised line endings) and commit it alone as the freeze commit.
