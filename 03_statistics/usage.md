# Usage (human)

> Owner: Experiment lead · Filled: prices before the run, nothing else (everything else is calculated by `tools/build-report.mjs` from the session transcript) · Agent: reads prices only

## Prices used for `usage.costUsd`

`tools/build-report.mjs` reads the price rows below, so keep the table shape: one row per model id used in the run, five prices per row, each with a `$`. A model without a row is left unpriced and listed in `usage.unpricedModels`.

Source and date: Anthropic first-party API list prices, Claude Code `claude-api` skill model table (cached 2026-09-25); cache-write multipliers 1.25× (5 min) and 2× (1 h) of the input price. Claude Code writes 1-hour cache entries. Check the prices against https://www.anthropic.com/pricing before each round and change the date if they changed; add a row for any other model used in the run (for example the small helper model, which costs under a cent and is otherwise left unpriced).

| Model | Input / MTok | Output / MTok | Cache read / MTok | Cache write 5 min / MTok | Cache write 1 h / MTok |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude-opus-5-5 | $4.00 | $20.00 | $0.20 | $5.00 | $8.00 |
